title: "Multi-GPU Implementation"
teaching: 45
exercises: 30
questions:
- "Extra: implementing multi-GPU parallelisation"
objectives:
- "Use OpenMP to create mutliple CPU threads"
- "Use OpenACC and OpenMP API functions to assign threads to devices"
- "Use update directives to synchronise halo-exchange boundaries"
